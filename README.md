No longer do music fans have to comb through Spotify's new release list to find that music gem. HappyFridays will do it for you! Every Friday, when new music is released, a user can see a list of new albums by their favorite artists. The app displays the new release albums as a list and allows the user to play the album or add the album to one of their own Spotify playlists.
